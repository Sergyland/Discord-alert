## README IS COMMING SOON

## Motivations

- At home or even at work, **you may have discord open a lot of the time**, ready to distract you with a new message. It is very popular, free, and offers tool to build bot applications such as this one.
- Github on the over hand is used for a large diversity of tasks, some of them requiring **important user attention**. In this regard, discord is a good way for **dispatching alerts**!
- Github provides **actions**, for free (even private repo can do some actions). These actions are triggered directly by github and executed on their server, everything is **automated**, **resilient** and **free**! Perfect!
- Github actions can be realy **easy to install and configure**. Just add a file in your repo and you're done!
